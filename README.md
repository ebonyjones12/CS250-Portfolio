## Module 8 Journal Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with active listening and asking the right questions to understand what users actually want to accomplish, not just what they think they need. During the SNHU Travel project, I learned that user stories are essential because they translate business requirements into actionable development tasks. When our project shifted from simple destination listings to vacation packages, user stories helped us understand the "why" behind each feature request. They force you to think from the user's perspective, "As a traveler, I want to see vacation packages so that I can easily compare options." This approach prevents developers from building technically correct solutions that don't actually solve the user's problem. User stories also create a shared language between stakeholders, developers, and testers, which eliminates a lot of the confusion that typically happens in software projects.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs has completely changed after experiencing Scrum-Agile methodology. Instead of trying to plan everything upfront, I now focus on breaking work into manageable sprints and getting feedback early and often. The processes I definitely want to incorporate include daily standups for maintaining team communication, sprint planning for realistic goal setting, and retrospectives for continuous improvement. I also see huge value in maintaining a prioritized backlog and being willing to adapt when requirements change. The collaborative aspects of Agile, like working closely with Product Owners and having regular stakeholder feedback, prevent you from going down the wrong path for weeks. I plan to always advocate for user story refinement sessions because they help identify technical dependencies before they become blockers.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means taking ownership of both your individual work and the team's collective success. During our project, I learned this means communicating proactively, if you're stuck on something, speak up immediately rather than struggling alone. It also means being adaptable when priorities shift and helping teammates when they need support. Good team members ask questions to clarify requirements instead of making assumptions, and they share knowledge freely rather than hoarding information. In our Scrum environment, I saw how important it is to be honest during retrospectives and daily standups, sugarcoating problems doesn't help anyone. Most importantly, a good team member focuses on delivering value to the end user, not just completing assigned tasks. The self-organizing nature of Agile teams means everyone needs to step up and contribute ideas for solving problems, not just wait for instructions.
